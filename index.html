                  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                  were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                  honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                  been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                  had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                  course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
                  life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
                  careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.
                  I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                  programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                  program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                  were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                  The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
                  learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
                  have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
                  example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
                  job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                  100% recommend! ”
